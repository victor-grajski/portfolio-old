## Introduction
- Journey is...
- First iteration of Capstone
- 4 week PDS project
- Advised by a private-practice psychotherapist
- 3 generative interviews with clients
- 3 evaluative interviews with same clients

## Problem Space
- Psychotherapists and their clients meet, at most, once a week
- A lot can happen between sessions
- Clients want to make sense of what’s happening and make the most of their sessions
- Therapists want to help their clients between sessions but they don’t have time

## Goals
- “Make the week feel a bit shorter”
- Mindfully continue the therapeutic process between sessions

## Target Users
- Private practice psychotherapists (modality-agnostic)
- Their clients

## Why Journaling?
- Literature
- Interview findings
-- Therapists: time constraints. clients also use their phones in session
-- Clients: To-Do List Effect

## Client-Side Highlights
- Dynamic Today view
- Journal highlights
- Timeline

## Provider-Side Highlights
- Choose Topics
- Confirm Next Session
- On Their Way Out
