## Landing Page
I decided to simplify the appointment landing page by routing most of the help text to the FAQs and bringing the actions to the top of the page. I believe this was the right decision because the amount of text on the page previously obscured what actions the user could take and repeated much of what users can find in the FAQs. I believe something like making an appointment online is a common enough pattern that users don't need a paragraph explaining how to do so.

## Booking an Appointment
On this screen, and many of the following screens, I separated each step in the process into its own screen and structured the decision process in a Q+A format. I believe this is the right solution to reduce cognitive load per screen.

I also included a progress bar with estimated time remaining in order to give users a sense of where they are in the process now that each screen has been atomized to one step in the process.

Finally, I included info boxes to clarify some of the finer details to the user without overwhelming them with text on the screen by default.
