## Hello, I'm Victor Grajski.

I'm a Product Designer, [musician](https://instagram.com/anima1a1a1a1), and a second-year Master's student at the [UC Berkeley School of Information](https://ischool.berkeley.edu).

Through studying at Berkeley, I have fully realized my desire to be a Product Designer because I can bring my whole self into the product development process, from listening and empathizing with users to delivering polished, beautiful artifacts that address their pain points.

Before transitioning to Berkeley, I had the good fortune to work as a Product Manager at Graphiq and as a Knowledge Engineer on the Alexa team at Amazon by way of the Graphiq acquisition.

Outside of work, in addition to being a musician, I love to surf, snowboard, road bike, and swim. I occasionally run. Slowly. So you won't find me signing up for an Ironman anytime soon!
